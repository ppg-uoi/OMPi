QUICK GUIDE
===========

In order to create a new library named "mylib" you first need to create a
folder named ee_mylib in runtime. Copy there the files from this directory
and rename "ortconf.LibraryNameHere" to "ortconf.mylib"

Edit ortconf.mylib according to your library.

In the Makefile.am change "PUT LIBRARY NAME HERE" to "mylib", list all the
sources for your library in "PUT LIBRARY SOURCES HERE" and the headers in
PUT LIBRARY HEADERS HERE

In configure.ac that's in the top directory, scroll down to the end and
put "runtime/ee_mylib/Makefile" in the AC_OUTPUT

OPTIONAL

1. If your library needs to be compiled by a different compiler than the one
   used for building ompicc, put a "Makelib.conf" in your library folder

2. If you want ompicc to create a Makefile along with the compiled program
   (for example when there is a special procedure involved when you need to
   run the program), use "MakefileTemplate", and list it in "ompilib_DATA"
   in Makefile.am. When you compile a program, ompicc will copy the Makefile
   in the folder it was called from (unless you pass the "--nomakefile" 
   option to ompicc) and then execute targets "compile" and "link" for 
   compiling and linking.
