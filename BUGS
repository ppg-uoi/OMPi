Known OMPi bugs/limitations
===========================

=> Unsupported OpenMP V4.5 constructs: simd, taskloop, teams, distribute 
   and user-defined reductions.
=> The atomic construct adheres to OpenMP V3.0.
=> C99 variable-size arrays are only supported outside parallel and task 
   regions. Of course, C99 programs should also be supported by the system 
   compiler.
=> For the moment, the parser cannot properly handle a variable 
   name if there exists a user-defined type with the same name.
=> The following do not work with the included process library (ee_process):
	 i) threadprivate variables ii) extern variables iii) tasks and 
	 iv) nested locks.
