Nested parallelism in OMPi 
--------------------------
    The OMPi team


OMPi's runtime system supports unlimited nested parallelism.
This means that threads may generate child threads
via  #pragma omp parallel  directives, to arbitrary depths
(this is only limited by the threading library --- see below).


The threading library
---------------------

The host runtime system (ORT) provides support for nested parallelism, 
but what actually happens at runtime depends on the capabilities 
of the threading ("execution entity") library in use (EELIB). 
OMPi comes with the following EELIBs (used to support some 
additional libraries, which are still available on request):

	pthreads
	psthr

The first one is installed by default and supports nested 
parallelism at arbitrary depths and arbitrary numbers of 
threads. The catch is that the oversubscription of processors 
is uncontrollable; the underlying operating system is 
responsible for scheduling many threads onto few processors, 
so overheads may rise. Be warned.

The above problems can be alleviated by using "psthr",
an advanced high-performance library with efficient nested 
parallelism support. It must be obtained and installed separately; 
psthr is available on OMPi's web page. OMPi provides a ready-to-use
interface for this library. 

More details can be found in file runtime.txt.
