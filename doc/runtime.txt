The host runtime system of OMPi & how to experiment with it
-----------------------------------------------------------
                     The OMPi team



--
1. GENERAL RUNTIME ARCHITECTURE OF OMPi
--

Since version 2.0.0, OMPi has a new runtime organization so as to  
support OpenMP 4 devices. It consists of two subsystems: 

  (a) the host subsystem (runtime/host) and
  (b) the device subsystem (runtime/dev_*).
  
What we describe here refers to the host subsystem. Documentation for
devices can be found in the corresponding file (runtime-dev.txt).


--
2. WHAT OMPi SHIPS WITH
--

OMPi is distributed with a number of different host runtime libraries,
and supports even more. By default, the "pthreads" library is 
installed with OMPi, unless a different choice was made at 
configuration time (see ../README file). This library is based
on POSIX threads and provides support for nested parallelism.


--
3. THE HOST RUNTIME SYSTEM
--

OMPi' host runtime system resides in runtime/host/ and consists of 
two main parts:

  (a) othr.c --- which provides execution entities (EEs) and locking 
                 functions. The EEs can be either threads or processes (in
                 the latter case use oprc.c instead of othr.c); 
                 we will only cover threads here.
  (b) ort.c  --- which uses othr.c to handle all runtime services.

The two parts are largely independent of each other while the
interface between them is fixed ((b) only expects (a) to 
provide the functions prototyped in "ee.h").

This means that anybody can develop his/her own threading 
library and use it instead of the one used in OMPi by default.
All s/he has to do is provide a new "othr.c" in place of
the default one and obey the "ee.h" interface (see the 
documentation in OMPi's website on how to do this).

The aforementioned libraries all use the same ort.c 
but have different (a) parts, which lie in:

  runtime/host/ee_pthreads
  runtime/host/ee_psthr

etc, correspondingly.


--
4. USING DIFFERENT HOST RUNTIME LIBRARIES
--

To facilitate experimenting with different threading libraries,
while keeping the ones shipped with OMPi, OMPi uses the following
scheme. Suppose you created a new EE library, named "foo" and you 
want be able to use it whenever you like (you will need the auto*
tools for this procedure):

  1. Create a directory named "ee_foo" in the runtime/host/ directory
     of OMPi's source distribution
     
  2. In there, put your "ee.h" file and your "othr.c" file.
  
  3. Provide a Makefile.am (just copy the one from e.g. ee_pthreads
     and change the libort_a_SOURCES & EXTRA_DIST lines)

  4. Create ortconf.foo (just copy the one from e.g. ee_pthreads) and
     set the appropriate flags. These are flags you want to be used 
     during preprocessing/compiling/linking of *user* programs when 
     your "foo" library is utilized by ompicc. ORTINFO is just a message
     to the user, while CPPFLAGS, CFLAGS and LDFLAGS are self-explanatory.
     For example, the "pthreads" library that comes with OMPi 
     (which is the default runtime library) has in "ortconf.pthreads":
         CPPFLAGS = -D_REENTRANT
         # No CFLAGS needed
         LDFLAGS = -lpthread
     
     Once again, these flags are NOT used to build your library.
     They are used when building user programs, linked with your 
     library. If you want special flags in order to build your 
     library, use the CPPFLAGS=..., CFLAGS=... parameters in 
     ./configure (see the Installation directions in the README file).
  
     Consult the next section for special needs of special libraries
     and how to provide for them in the ortconf.foo file.

  5. Add a line to the AC_OUTPUT macro at the end of "configure.in":
         runtime/host/ee_foo/Makefile

  6. In the root directory of OMPi's source distribution execute:
        ./configure --with-ortlib=foo ...
        cd runtime      # we only make the lib, not the whole of OMPi
        make clean      # to clean up any previous library leftovers
        make            
        make install

From now on, OMPi's default runtime library will be based on "foo".
Any OpenMP programs compiled by ompicc will be linked against this new 
lib. In case you want to build a user program with any other
library, use the --ort flag of ompicc, e.g.

    ompicc --ort=psthr program.c

will link the user program against the psthr library.

Notice that the above procedure does NOT overwrite any other libraries
installed. Each one of them is safely installed in a separate
directory. It only forces OMPi to use "foo" as its default library.
If you want to create foo but not make it the default library of OMPi,
use the --disable-defaultlib flag when configuring:

        ./configure --with-ortlib=foo --disable-defaultlib ...
        cd runtime
        ...


--
5. SPECIAL SITUATIONS
--

There are two special cases which are handled as follows:

   (i) If you provide EEs based on processes, you *MUST* add
       "-DOMPI_MEMMODEL=PROCESS" to your CFLAGS 
       in ortconf.foo.

  (ii) There are some threading libraries that need to supply
       their own main(), overriding the one written by the user.
       To handle this, add "-DOMPI_MAIN=LIB" to your CFLAGS 
       in ortconf.foo.
       In this case, OMPi will rename the user's main function
       to "__ompi_main()". You should then call it from the
       library's main function when fit; always call it as
       __ompi_main(argc, argv) (OMPi makes sure it always
       has the argc, argv arguments). 
       See runtime/host/ee_psthr/ for an example.


--
6. USING PSTHR (psthreads)
--

***** IMPORTANT NOTE:
***** Since version 1.2.3 of OMPi, version 1.0.4 of psthreads is needed.

Process Scope threads (psthreads) is an open-source threading library 
that implements a two-level thread model: non-preemptive user-level 
threads are executed on top of kernel-level threads. It offers 
high-performance, unlimited nested parallelism support. Psthreads 
is a separate software package that has to be configured and 
installed into your system. It is distributed under the GNU 
General Public License and can be downloaded from the OMPi's 
web site: http://paragroup.cs.uoi.gr/wpsite/software.

Before using psthreads with OMPi, you have to install psthreads 
separately in your system. Psthreads installs two scripts
(psthreads_cflags and psthreads_libs), which should lie on your 
$PATH.

Assuming that you are currently working in the root directory 
of OMPi's source tree, here is all that is needed:

        ./configure CFLAGS="`psthreads_cflags`" --with-ortlib=psthr ...
	cd lib
	make clean
        make
        make install

and use as in:  ompicc --ort=psthr program.c
