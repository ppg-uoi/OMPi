| Version 2.0.0                                                             |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
This version represents a major re-organization of OMPi. 
Some of the changes:

  + First public version to support OpenMP V.4.0 (target/target data/
    target update/declare target, cancellation and taskgroup constructs)
  + General infrastructure for devices.
  + Support for the Adapteva Epiphany accelerator (cf. Parallella boards).
  + Re-designed compiler outlining
  + Updated documentation.
  * Completely reorganized runtime and compiler trees.
  * Bug fixes
  
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Version 1.2.3                                                             |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  + Final release for OpenMP V.3.x; the next release will support 
    OpenMP V.4.0 constructs.
  + Due to requests, the process library (ee_process) has been added
    which utilizes heavyweight processes instead of threads and SysV-style
    shared memory. It has a number of limitations, though (see BUGS).
  * Various improvements especially in tasking
  * Bug fixes
  
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Version 1.2.2                                                             |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  + Support for most parts of OpenMP v3.1 (final, mergeable, min, max,
    omp_in_final(), OMP_NUM_THREADS)
  + Some new OMPi-specific extensions (see our HOMPI paper), disabled
    by default.
  * Improvements in tasking
  * Experimental tasking implementation in psthr.
  * Bug fixes
  
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Version 1.2.0                                                             |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  - Dropped some runtime libraries from distribution tarball (pthreads1,
    solthr, solthr1, marcel); support still provided for them on request.
  + Full OpenMP 3.0 support (including the "collapse" clause)
  * Improved runtime (tasks)
  * Fully compliant threadprivate handling
  * Bug fixes
    
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Version 1.1.0                                                             |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Again, a lot of changes. Some of them:

  + OpenMP 3.0 (except the "collapse" clause)
  + Tasks
  + Default pthreads library now offers unlimited (but not optimized)
    nested parallelism. Psthr should be preferred for deep nesting
    levels and/or large numbers of threads.
  + OMPi extensions built in, but disabled by default

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Version 1.0.0                                                             |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Too many changes. Indeed, too many changes to mention.
For the casual programmer, things should seem (almost) unchanged. 
For the hacker, there are important changes; the doc/ directory 
must be consulted.

  + Brand new translator
  + Full OpenMP 2.5 compatibility
  + Full support for nested parallelism available
  + OMPi now supports threads, processes and mixtures of processes and threads
  - Dropped support for POMP
  * Changed the runtime structure a bit (see doc/runtime.txt) and
    the directory structure in lib/

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Version 0.9.1f (Aug 2007)                                                 |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
All old threadprivate code removed; new & better code used now everywhere.
  ( ort_get_thrpriv() is the one and only relevant function in ort.c )
ort_destroy_team() abolished; code subsumed by ort_create_team(), 
  which was renamed to ort_execute_parallel().

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Version 0.9.1e (Aug 2007)                                                 |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
ort_assign_key() abolished; ort_get_thread_work() does it internally.
  This is of great help to the parser, too.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Version 0.9.0                                                             |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Added support for psthreads and marcel threads 
Going public.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Version 0.8.6f2 (June 2007)                                               |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Bug fixes in parser-generated code for CRITICAL
Bug fix in PTHREADS and SOLTHREADS thanx to M.-C.C

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Version 0.8.6 (May 2007)                                                  |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Major release; going public.
One of the upcoming releases will utilize a brand new parser.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Versions up to 0.8.6                                                      |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Complete redesign of the runtime library (ORT); might well be one of the 
fastest OpenMP runtime libraries around!
Threading libraries now are independent; hacking should be very easy.
ORT fully supports nested parallelism; simple and elaborate libraries included.
Bug fixes and improvements in the parser and the produced code.
Too many things, too fast!

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Version 0.8.4 (VVD, July 2006)                                            |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Fixed bug in parser when producing code for nested ORDEREDs. Now
the for_info structure is stacked so as to be saved/restored.

The for_data structure is NO LONGER needed (removed from the
parser's output code AND the runtime library). It was only needed
in nested ORDEREDs. Now, the necessary info is passed to
the runtime library by the parser's produced code thus no
for_data stacking is needed.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Versions up to 0.8.4                                                      |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Too many little things.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Version 0.8.2 (17 Sep 2004)                                               |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
[+] Implemented pomp - compliant performance instrumentation.
    To enable code instrumentation, use "ompicc --pomp-enable".
    The supplied pomp-library is not useful (it only printf's messages),
    so in order to actually use pomp you should download EPILOG
    from http://www.fz-juelich.de/zam/kojak/, compile it and copy
    libelg.a over the existing libpomp.a.
    To graphically monitor the performance results (*.elg) you should
    download and install CUBE from http://icl.cs.utk.edu/kojak/cube.
[+] Gathered thread API to [othread.h, generic_othread_types.h,
    sparc_othread_types.h, generic_othread.c, sparc_othread.c].
    Now it is easier to support other thread packages without messing
    with the parser.
[+] OMPi now implements <omp.h> using either pthreads or Solaris threads.
    To select Solaris threads use "./configure --enable-solaristhreads"
    There is also internal (developer) support for IRIX spinlocks.
[+] Padded lock structures to 64 bytes so that no 2 locks fit in the same
    cache line. This also optimizes barriers.
[+] GCC no longer implements <varargs.h>, code revised to use <stdarg.h>
[+] Removed redundant implicit barriers (= optimization). If two #pragma omp
    directives that require an implicit ending barrier happen to close
    "together", only one barrier is inserted.
[+] Changed nested locks implementation to use PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE.
    In Solaris threads the code still uses condition variables due to
    a SunOS <= 5.8 bug.
[+] Removed condition variables from the ORDERED implementation.
    ORDERED is now implemented with simple locks, resulting in safer
    and faster code.
[+] omp_get_wtime now uses the best clock available to the host system
    (Linux, Solaris, Irix)
[+] Implemented as weak symbols the following functions:
      void omp_barrier_init(void *bar, int n);
      void omp_barrier_wait(void *bar);
      void omp_barrier_destroy(void *bar);
    Now the user can define these functions and override the built-in
    implementation.
[+] Added doxygen style documentation to the source code.
[+] Added OMPi.kdevelop to work within KDevelop 3.0+.
[+] Added SAFE_MALLOC macro for error-checked memory allocation.
[+] Passed the _OPENMP, _POMP definitions as compiler options, so that user
    code like
      #ifdef _OPENMP
      #include <omp.h>
      #endif
    works.
[+] Some other bug fixes and minor optimizations
